This is a **bold ** sdf** _text_ example **sdf**
Here's an _italic_ text example

You can use monospaced text for code snippets like `print("Hello, world!")`

Preformatted text can _be_useful_ for preserving whitespace:

```
def greet(name):
    _print("Hello, " + name)_
greet("world")
```
In conclusion, Markdown is a versatile formatting language that allows you to easily add emphasis, code blocks, and preformatted text to your documents.
